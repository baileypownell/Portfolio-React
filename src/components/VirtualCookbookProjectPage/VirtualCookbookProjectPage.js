              <p>Built with React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, this fullstack single page application involved a lot of software design concepts I hadn't used before. Although I would never do this for a truly production-level application, I decided to handle authentication myself. I used Nodemailer for sending emails when users want to change their password (for enhanced security), built the API from scratch, and used bcrypt.js for password hashing. I also added session-based authentication after reading a very convincing article against JWTs <a target="_blank" href="http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2016/06/13/stop-using-jwt-for-sessions/">here</a>. This project came about not by following a tutorial but because I actually needed something like this in my life.
