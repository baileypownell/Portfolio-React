              <p>Built with React, Node.js, Express, MaterializeCSS, and PostgreSQL, this fullstack single page application involved a lot of software design concepts I hadn't used before. Although I would never do this for a truly production-level application, I decided to handle authentication myself. I used Nodemailer for sending emails when users want to change their password (for enhanced security), built the API from scratch, and used bcrypt.js for password hashing. I decided to use session-based authentication after reading a very convincing article against using JWTs for authentication <a target="_blank" href="http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2016/06/13/stop-using-jwt-for-sessions/">here</a>. This project came about not by following a tutorial but because I actually needed something like this in my life.

              <img className="project-photo" src="images/recipe_desktop.png"></img>
              <p>I eventually added the ability to filter recipes by name and catgory. After that, I added functionality to "tag" recipes by features such as sugar-free, dair-free, vegan, etc.</p>
